### User Stories

As a user I can start typing in the input box and:

- results will be overlayed in screen

- I can see updated results and I continue typing

The **Book Auto Completer** engine, We started out with a simple plan to create a front end web page which makes a call to a back end server with a few assets which it serves as well as sending a query (the user's input) to this back end which it searches through and returns a matching string of books names.
